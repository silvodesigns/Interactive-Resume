# Interactive-Resume
Second project I created as a requirement to graduate from the Front end Web developent program at Udacity.

#Project Description
Using jQuery, developed an interactive resume application that reads all data from a JSON file
and then dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information. Further customized the project by personalizing the design using CSS.

#How to Use
In order to get the web application started, simply open the index.html file with your favorite browser. Once in the website,
try to interact with the google map.

#Skills Implemented
HTML
CSS 
JAVASCRIPT 
JQUERY
